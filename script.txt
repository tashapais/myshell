EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
          The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
          French call cow country).
          We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

          CHAPTER ONE

          "ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

          NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
          This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

          "1941
          One year into the German
          occupation of France".
          The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
          about.
          The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
          up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
          sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
          year, or just started today.

          JULIE
          One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
          the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
          noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

          JULIE'S POV:
          A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
          the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
          back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
          over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

          JULIE
          Pappa.
          The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
          and see's the Germans approaching.
          The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
          followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
          approaching.
          The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          FARMER
          Go back inside and shut the door.

          

          

          

          

          IL

          FARMER
          (to Julie)
          Julie, get me some water from the pump
          to wash up with, then get inside with
          your mother.
          The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
          basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
          splashing into the basin.
          The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
          away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
          his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
          a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
          very well be the end.
          Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
          sill.

          JULIE
          Ready Pappa.

          FARMER
          Thank you darling, now go inside and
          take care of your mother. Don't run.
          Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
          As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
          sill with the water basin...
          .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
          The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
          front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
          his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
          automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
          Party come to a halt on his property.
          We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
          the Farmer.
          The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
          attention next to them.
          The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
          for his superior.
          The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

          NAZI OFFICER
          This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          

          

          

          

          3

          NAZI DRIVER
          Yes heer Colonel.
          The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
          in his left hand
           n d

          OFFICER
          Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
          left alone.

          NAZI DRIVER
          As you wish Heer Col.
          The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          NAZI OFFICER
          Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          FARMER
          I am Perrier LaPadite.
          The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
          and says in French with a smile on his face;

          NAZI OFFICER
          It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
          LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
          the S.S.
          COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
          The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

          PERRIER
          How may I help you?

          COL LANDA
          I was hoping you could invite me inside
          your home and we may have a discussion.

          INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
          The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
          the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
          inside the Frenchman's home.
          Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
          and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
          in his direction.
          The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

          

          

          

          

          VA

          PERRIER
          Colonel Landa, this is my family.
          The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
          French Farmers Wife...

          COL LANDA
          Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
          at your service.
          He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
          hand...

          COL LANDA
          please excuse my rude intrusion on your
          routine.

          FARMERS WIFE
          Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
          While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
          eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
          heard in the village about your family
          are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
          woman.
          His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

          COL.LANDA

          (CON' T )
          And each of your daughters is more lovely
          then the last.

          PERRIER
          Merci. Please have a seat.
          The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
          dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
          and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
          the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
          feet.
          The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

           PERRIER
          Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
          The Colonel some wine?

          

          

          

          

          COL LANDA
          Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
          wine. This being a dairy farm one would
          be safe in assuming you have milk?

          CHARLOTTE
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Then milk is what I prefer.

          CHARLOTTE
          Very Well.
          The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
          and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
          The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
          LOUDLY on the wooden table.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur, to both your family, and your
          cows, I say; Bravo.

          PERRIER
          Merci.

          COL LANDA
          Please, join me at your
          table.

          PERRIER
          Very well.
          The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
          The Nazi.
          The Women remain standing.
          Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

          CONFIDENTIALLY;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
          discuss,' would be better discussed in
          private. You'll notice, I left my men
          outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
          could you ask your lovely ladies to step
          outside.

          PERRIER
          You are right.

          

          

          

          

          G.

          PERRIER
          (to his women)
          Charlotte, would you take the girls
          outside. The Colonel and I need to have
          a few words.
          The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
          daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
          The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
          humble home.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
          you I've exhausted the extent of my
          French. To continue to speak it so
          inadequately, would only serve to
          embarrass me. However, I've been lead
          to believe you speak English quite well?

          PERRIER
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
          This being your house, I ask your
          permission to switch to English, for the
          remainder of the conversation?

          PERRIER
          By all means.
          They now speak ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
          familiar with you, and your family.
          I have no way of knowing if you are
          familiar with who I am. Are you aware
          of my existence?
          The Farmer answers;

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          This is good. Are you aware of the job
          I've been ordered to carry out in France?

          

          

          

          

          I

          PERRIER
          Yes.
          The Colonel drinks more milk.

          COL LANDA
          Please tell me what you've heard?

          PERRIER
          I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
          charge of rounding up the Jews left in
          France who are ether hiding, or passing
          for Gentile.
          The S.S.Colonel smiles.

          COL LANDA
          The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
          himself.

          PERRIER
          But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.

          COL LANDA
          I'm aware of that, I read the report on
          this area. But like any enterprise,
          when under new management, there's
          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur
          LaPadite, if you can assist me with
          answers, my department can close the
          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;

          COL LANDA
          Now before the occupation there were
          four Jewish families in this area, all
          dairy farmers like yourself.
          The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
          and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?

          

          

          

          

          8,

          PERRIER
          To my knowledge those were the Jewish
          families among the dairy farmers.
          - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
          I smoked my pipe?
          Looking up from his papers.

          COL LANDA
          Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
          house, make yourself comfortable.
          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.

          COL LANDA
          Now according to these papers, all
          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.
          (looking up from
          his papers, across
          the table at The

          FARMER)
          What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
          Monsieur LaPadite?

          PERRIER
          Only rumors -

          COL LANDA
          - I love rumors! Facts can be so
          misleading, where rumors, true or false
          are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
          what rumors have you heard regarding
          The Dreyfusis?
          The Farmerlooks at Landa.

          

          

          

          

          I.

          COL LANDA
          Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
          to hear what the rumors are, not who told
          them to you.
          The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

          PERRIER
          Again, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
          into Spain.

          COL LANDA
          So the rumors you've heard have been of
          escape?

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
          friendly?
          As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
          chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
          floorboards revealing;

          FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
          lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
          dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.

          PERRIER
          We were families in the same community,
          in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
          we were friends, but members of the same
          community, we had common interest.
          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.

          COL LANDA
          Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
          you confirm for me the exact members of
          the household and their names?

          

          

          

          

          10.

          PERRIER
          There were five of them.
          The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
          her brother, Bob ...

          COL LANDA
          - How old is Bob?

          PERRIER
          Thirty - thirty one?

          COL LANDA
          Continue.

          PERRIER
          And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.

          COL LANDA
          Ages of the children?

          PERRIER
          Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
          was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
          sure.

          CUT TO

          UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY
          The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
          clothes line.
          They can't hear anything going on inside.
          e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.

          SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

          COL LANDA
          Well I guess that should do it.
          Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
           ttache case.
          the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

          COL LANDA
          However, before I go, could I have another
          glass of your delicious milk?

          

          

          

          
          it.

          PERRIER
          But of course.
          Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
          aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
          German Officer talks.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
          nickname the people of France have given
          me?

          PERRIER
          I have no interest in such things.

          COL LANDA
          But you are aware of what they call me?

          PERRIER
          I'm aware.

          COL LANDA
          What are you aware of?

          PERRIER
          That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

          COL LANDA
          Precisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.

          The feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.

          Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
          smell - physical strength - penis size.
          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?

          PERRIER
          I suppose I would.

          COL LANDA
          Has a rat ever done anything to you to
          create this animosity you feel toward
          them?

          PERRIER
          Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

          COL LANDA
          - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?

          PERRIER
          No.

          COL LANDA
          Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
          not? And except for the fact that one
          has a big bushy tail, while the other
          has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
          they even rather look alike, don't they?

          It is a interesting thought,
          beer Colonel.

          COL LANDA
          However, interesting as the thought may
          be, it makes not one bit of difference
          to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
          through your door, this very minute,
          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?

          PERRIER
          Probably not.

          COL LANDA
          I didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's the

          METAPHOR
          sink in)
          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.

          The other mistake the German soldier
          make is their severe handling of the
          citizens who give shelter and aid to
          the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
          of the state. They are simply confused
          people, trying to make some sense out of
          the madness war creates.
          These citizens do not need punishing.
          They simply need to be reminded of their
          duty in war time.
          Let's use you as a example Monsieur
          LaPadite. In this war, you have found
          yourself in the middle of a conflict
          that has nothing to do with yourself,
          your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
          here you are.
          So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
          a question. In this time of war, what is
          your number one duty? Is it to fight the
          Germans in the name of France to your
          last breath? Or, is it to harass the
          occupying army to the best of your
          ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
          unfortunate victims of warfare who can
          not protect themselfs?
          Or, is your number one duty in this time
          of bloodshed, to protect those very
          beautiful women who constitute your
          family?
          The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

          COL LANDA
          That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
          In this time of war, What do you consider
          your number one duty?

          PERRIER
          To protect my family.

          COL LANDA
          Now, my job dictates, that I must have
          my men enter your home, and conduct a
          thorough search, before I can officially
          cross your families name off my list.

          And if there are any irregularities to be
          found, rest assured, they will be.
          That is unless, you have something to tell
          me that will make the conducting of a
          search unnecessary.

          (PAUSE)
          I might add also, that any information
          that makes the preforming of My duty
          easier, will not be met with punishment.
          Actually quite the contrary, it will be
          met with reward.
          And that reward will be, your family
          will cease to be harassed in anyway,
          by the German military during the rest
          of our occupation of your country.

          the same thing. She's a young girl, no food,
          no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed
          the massacre of her entire family.
          She may not survive the night. And after
          word spreads about what happened today,
          it's highly unlikely she will find any
          willing farmers to extend her aid.
          If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
          probably be turned in by some neighbour.
          Or, she'll be spotted by some German
          soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
          woods, dead from starvation or exposure.
          Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will
          elude capture. She will escape to America.

          No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
          the rumors myself! Solders of The Third
          Reich, who have brought the world to
          there knee`s, now pecking and clucking
          like chickens. Do you know the latest
          rumor they've conjured up, in their fear
          induced delirium? The one that beats
          my boys with a bat. The one they call
          "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
          A avenging jew angel, conjured up by
          a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

          GENERAL
          Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers
          gossip, no one really believes The
          Bear Jew is a golem.

          HITLER
          Why not? They seem to be able to elude
          capture like a aberration.
          They seem to be able to appear and
          disappear at will.

          You want to prove their flesh and
          blood? Then BRING THEM TO ME!
          I will hang them naked, by their
          heels, from the eiffel tower!
          And then throw their bodies in
          the sewers, for the rats of Paris
          to feast!
          The Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself, and
          wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

          HITLER

          (DISGUSTED)
          The Bear Jew.
          He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.

          KLIEST1
          KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom;

          KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)
          Year mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          I have a order I want relayed to all
          German soldiers stationed in France.
          The Jew degenerate known as The Bear
          Jew, hence forth, is never to be
          referred to as The Bear Jew again.
          We will cease to aid the Americans
          any longer in there attempt to
          undermine the German soldier psyche.
          Did you get that Kliest?

          KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)
          Yes mine Fubrer. Do you still wish
          to see Private Butz?

          HITLER
          Who and what is a private Butz?

          KELIST'S VOICE(OS)
          He's the soldier you wanted to see
          personally. His squad was ambushed
          by Lt.Raines Jews. He was it's only
          survivor.

          HITLER
          Indeed I do want to see him, thank
          you for reminding me. Send him in.

          CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER
          His head lies on the ground horizontal. A HAND reaches into
          FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriots helmet, and
          grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair. A LARGE KNIFE
          ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
          This process is called SCALPING.
          After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off like a
          banana.

          GERMAN PRISONERS PVT.BUTZ AND SGT.RACHTMAN

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          Werner and I were the only ones left
          alive after the ambush. While one man
          guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
          All The Basterds wore German scalps
          tied to their belts.

          CU SCALPS
          hanging from belts.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          They not only took valuables...

          WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF
          Rings, Weapons, Iron Cross, and somebody digging out a Gold
          Tooth with a knife, being removed from Dead Germans.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          ..They also took their identification
          papers.

          CU IDENTIFICATION PAPERS
          taken from the inside pocket of a dead German uniform.

          BASTERD PFC.UTIVICH
          flips through the I.D. papers till he gets to the page that
          contains the German soldiers, name, statistics, and photo.

          scalps removed from their heads, pink bare feet...

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          The Basterds, took their lives, their
          hair, their valuables, their identity,
          and finally their dignity in death.
          True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
          does rob the tableaux of a certain dignity, that is normally
          felt in battlefield shots.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS
          Aldo screams to The Basterd who's guarding the two German
          prisoners.

          LT.ALDO
          Hey Hirschberg, send that kraut
          sarge over.

          BASTERD PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          KICKS Sgt.Rachtman in the back.

          

          

          

          
          zw.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          You! Go!
          Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
          grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
          in the ass, sending him on his way.
          Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
          Aldo in the middle.
          As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
          A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
          the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
          interrogations since Germany decided
          it should rule Europe. But this is
          the first time he's ever been on the
          wrong end of the exchange.
          It's always been his belief, only a
          weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
          complies with the enemy under threat
          of consequence.
          As Werner watched men cry like women,
          pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
          exchange for their worthless lives,
          he made a vow to himself.
          If his role is to die in this conflict.
          When they put him under the earth, his
          dignity would be buried with him.
          For in the other world, the gods only
          respect the ones they test first.
          Well Sgt, this is your test.
          And the gods are watching.
          The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
          stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
          salutes his captor.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

          (ENGLISH)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman.
          Aldo returns the salute, looking up at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Lt.Aldo Raine, pleased to meet cha.
          You know what sit down means Werner?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Then sit down.

          

          

          

          

          2.5.
          The German Sgt does.

          LT.ALDO
          Hows your English Werner? Cause if
          need be, we gotta a couple fellas
          can translate.
          Aldo points at one of The Basterds in the circle,

          CPL.WILHELM WICKI.

          LT.ALDO
          Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the
          fuck outta Saltzberg, while the
          gettin was good. Became American,
          got drafted, and came back to give
          y'all what for.
          Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big scary looking
          Basterd, in a German Sgt's uniform, named, SGT.HUGO STIGLITZ

          LT.ALDO
          And another one over there, you
          might be familiar with, Sgt.Hugo
          Stiglitz. Heard of 'em.
          The two German Sgt's look at each other.

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Everybody in the German army's heard
          of Hugo Stiglitz.
          The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back.
          The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's
          celebrity among German soldiers
          is simple.
          WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
          of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

          NARRATOR(VO)
          As a German enlisted man, he killed
          thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly
          Majors.

          WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

          

          

          

          

          ZC.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Instead of putting him up against a
          wall, the High Command decided to
          send him back to Berlin, to be made
          a example of.
          Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
          prison convoy, enroute to Berlin.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Needless to say, once The Basterds
          heard about him, he never got there.

          EXT- FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
          The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
          They walk to the back of the troop truck, inside Hugo in
          chains, stares back at them.

          LT.ALDO
          Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz?
          Hugo nods.

          LT. ALDO
          I'm Lt.Aldo Raine, and these are
          The Basterds. Ever heard of us?
          Hugo nods his head, yes.

          LT.ALDO
          We just wanna say, we're a big fan
          of your work. When it comes to killin
          Nazi's, I think you show great talent,
          and I pride myself on havin a eye for
          that kind of talent. But your status
          as a Nazi killer, is still amateur.
          We all came here to see, if you wanna go pro?

          BACK TO THEBASTERD CIRCLE.

          LT.ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna assume you know
          who we are?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Aldo the Apache.
          The circle of Basterds giggle.

          

          

          

          

          Z7.

          LT.ALDO
          Well Werner, if you heard of us, you
          probably heard, we ain't in the
          prisoner takin business. We in the
          killin Nazi business. And cousin,
          business is boomin.
          The Basterds laugh.

          LT. ALDO
          Now that leaves two ways we can play
          this out. Either kill ya, or let ya
          go. Now weather or not you gonna
          leave this circle alive, depends
          entirely on you.
          Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front
          of his prisoner.

          LT.ALDO
          Up the road a piece, there's a
          orchard. 'sides you, we know there's
          another kraut patrol fuckin around
          here somewhere. Now if that patrol
          were to have any crackshots, that
          orchard, would be a goddamn snipers
          delight. Now if you ever wanna eat
          a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
          gotta show me on this map, where
          they are, you gotta tell me how many
          they are, and you gotta tell me,
          what kinda artillery they carrying
          with 'em?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          You can't expect me to divulge
          information that would put German
          lives in danger?

          LT.ALDO
          well, Werner that's where your wrong.
          Because that's exactly what I expect.
          I need to know about Germans hidin
          in trees? And you need to tell me?
          And you need to tell me, right now?
          Now take your finger, and point out
          on this map, where this partys bein
          held, how manys comin, and what they
          brought to play with?
          Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
          inch the German hero facing death.

          

          

          

          

          2S.

          SGT.WERNER
          F I respectfully refuse, sir.
          Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

          LT.ALDO
          You see that ole boy battin rocks?
          WE RACK FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle.
          He's wearing a wife beater, and power hitting stones
          with a baseball bat.
          Werners eyes go to the ballplayer.

          LT.ALDO
          That's Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you
          might know him better by his nickname,
          The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of
          Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about
          The Bear Jew?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          I heard.

          LT.ALDO
          What did you hear?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          He beats German soldiers with a club.

          LT.ALDO
          He bashes their brains in with a
          baseball bat, what he does.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
          rock soaring into the atmosphere.

          LT. ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna ask you one
          last-goddamn-time, and if you still,
          "respectfully refuse", I'm callin The
          Bear Jew over here, and he's gonna take
          that big bat of his, and he's gonna
          beat your ass to death with it.
          Now take your wennersitnitzel lickin
          finger, and point out on this map
          what I want to know.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

          Aldo says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice;

          LT.ALDO
          Actually Werner, we're all tickled
          ya said that. Frankly, watchin Donny

          DONNY
          No.
          Donny's "no", silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
          settle on one, feeling it's weight in his hands.

          DONNY
          Can I try this one on for size, outside?

          

          

          

          

          31.
          Extending his arm;

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Be my guest.
          The phone rings.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          I'll get that, you go right ahead.
          The proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a
          conversation with his OFF SCREEN Mother.
          Donny walks outside, WE STAY IN STORE, but can see him
          clearly through the stores big picture window.
          However, Mr.Goorowitz instinctively, turns his back to Donny
          to speak with his mother.
          Donny starts swinging the bat. It's pretty obvious he's
          pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then the
          he starts yelling;

          DONNY
          Take that ya Nazi basterd! You like fuckin
          with the Jews? Wanna Fuck with the Jews?
          The American jews are gonna FUCK with
          you... ..!
          Mr.Goorowitz, see's none of this, as he speaks to his
          mother. He hangs up the phone, just as Donny walks back into
          the store. Store owner turns to store customer.

          DONNY
          Is this the heaviest ya got?

          CUT TO

          INT - HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          Donny, dressed nice, in a apartment building in his Jewish
          Bastin neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
          A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
          peering out at the young man.

          OLD WOMAN
          How can I help you?

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          State your business young man.

          

          

          

          

          3Z..

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, I'm Donny Donowitz,
          my father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber
          shop on Greeny Ave, "Sy's Barber Shop".

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I've seen it. Do you live in the
          neighbourhood?

          DONNY
          All my life.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Again, state your business?

          DONNY
          May I have a word with you?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What about?

          DONNY
          Our people in Europe.
          She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
          young man.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Come in. Would you like some tea?

          INT - MRS.HIMMELSTEIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
          Donny sits on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
          saucer in his hand. Mrs.Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed
          chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

          DONNY
          (Sipping tea)
          Very good.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          If you like tea.
          Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
          stone. She wasn't joking. He places his saucer on the coffee
          table and begins;

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love
          ones over in Europe who your concerned
          for?

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What compels you young man, to ask a
          stranger such a personal question?

          DONNY
          Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm
          gonna make it right.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

          DONNY

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And what exactly do you intend to do
          with that toy?

          DONNY
          I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to
          death with it.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I thought we were having tea together?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And in this pursuit, how is it that I
          can be of service?

          DONNY
          I'm going through the neighbourhood.
          If you have any love ones in Europe,
          who's safety you fear for, I'd like
          you to write their name on my bat.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
          As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER
          WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK and FORTE BETWEEN DONNY and

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN...

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          You must be a real BASTERD, Donny?

          

          

          

          

          DONNY
          You bet your sweet ass I am.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Good. A Basterds work is never done.
          Specially in Germany.
          Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;

          DONNY
          Gimmie your papers.
          Werner hands Donny up his papers.
          Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
          pocket.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe
          I will join you on this journey.

          INSERT
          she signs the BAT, "MADELEINE"

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
          The Basterds.

          PVT.BUTZ
          watches. Hirschberg says to him;

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          About now, I'd be shittin my pants, if
          I was you.
          Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          That means you, cup cake.
          A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.

          LT.ALDO
          You wanna live?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes, sir.

          LT.ALDO
          Point out on this map, the German
          position.
          His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the
          positions.

          

          

          

          
          3 s.

          PVT.BUTZ
          This area here.

          LT.ALDO
          How many?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Maybe twelve.

          LT.ALDO
          What kinda of artillery?

          PVT.BUTZ
          They have a machine gunn dug in here
          pointing north.

          HITLER
          How did you survived this ordel?
          WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
          He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
          Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

          PRVT.BUTZ
          They let me go.

          FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

          LT.ALDO
          Now when you report what happened here,
          you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you
          told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna
          wanna know, why you so special, we let you
          live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you
          could spread the word through the ranks,
          what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

          HITLER
          You are not to tell anybody anything!
          Not one word of detail! Your outfit
          was ambushed, and you got a away.
          Not one word more.

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Did they mark you like they did the
          other survivors?

          

          

          

          

          36â�¢

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Remove your hat and show me.

          LT.ALDO
          Now say we let ya go, and say you
          survive the'war? When you get back
          home, what'eha gonna do?

          PVT.BUTZ
          I will hug my mother like I've never
          hugged her before.

          LT.ALDO
          Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you
          going to take off your uniform?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Not only shall I remove it, but I intend
          to burn it!
          The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
          to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
          thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
          like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
          in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,
          just like that.
          (Snaps his fingers)
          But you take off that uniform, ain't
          nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
          And that don't sit well with us.
          Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

          LT.ALDO
          So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin,
          you can't take off.

          BACK TO HITLER
          Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face,
          his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND

          CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BUTZ'S POV:
          on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
          swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife. All The
          Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty
          good at that.

          LT. ALDO
          You know how you get to Carnegie Hall,
          don't 'ch? Practice.

          CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

          CHAPTER THREE

          "GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"
          NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave
          Black and White.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
          CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
          screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
          the little glass window in the back of the theatre
          The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
          Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
          of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
          We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
          German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
          The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
          German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

          TILL...
          .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
          movie.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

          "1941

          PARIS

          TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

          OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
          We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
          The lights go up in the auditorium.
          Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
          somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
          their coats, and file out.

          

          

          

          

          3P.

          EXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT
          Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
          SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

          EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
          A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
          is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
          the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

          INT - AUDITORIUM

          CU SHOSANNA
          still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
          empty.
          The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
          who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
          one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
          Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
          the empty cinema.
          The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

          ENGLISH.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
          we're closed for the evening. I must assume
          you want something. What can I do for you?

          SHOSANNA
          May I sleep here tonight?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So I gather your not a nurse?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          But your a bright little thing, that's
          clever disguise. Where is your family?

          SHOSANNA
          Murdered.

          

          

          

          

          3 1.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So your a war orphan?

          SHOSANNA
          We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Is this a sad story?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
          in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
          with mine, don't bore me with yours.

          SHOSANNA
          You can run the machines?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          What machines?
          Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
          projector, she says;

          SHOSANNA
          The machines that show the film?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
          of course I can operate them.

          SHOSANNA
          I know, I saw you.

          FLASH ON:

          CU SHOSANNA
          eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
          watching...

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          expertly working the projectors...

          BACK TO SHOSANNA

          SHOSANNA
          Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
          that show the film. It's only you and
          the negro. I know you could use some help.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I know at least six people who've been
          put up against a wall, and machine
          gunned for sheltering enemies of the
          state. I have no intention of being
          unlucky number seven. How long have
          you been in Paris?

          SHOSANNA
          A week, and a few days.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          How have you survived the curfew
          without capture?

          SHOSANNA
          I sleep on rooftops.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
          girl. How is it?

          SHOSANNA
          Cold.

          MADAME MIMIEUX

          (LAUGHS)
          I can imagine.

          SHOSANNA
          Respectfully, no you can't.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Fair enough.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
          you want me teach you, in order to work
          here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
          to hide in, is that correct?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Whats your name?

          SHOSANNA
          Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
          me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
          home for wayward war orphans.
          Having said that, what you say is true.
          If you were truly exceptional, I could
          find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
          truly exceptional?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I will be the judge of that.

          DISSOLVE TO

          TITLE CARD:
          Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
          complete with Eiffel Tower.

          ABOVE IT READS:

          "1944

          PARIS"

          THEN...
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
          CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
          Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
          Month is JUNE.
          ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
          as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
          Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
          A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
          will be "Shosanna's Theme".
          A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
          alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
          Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
          she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

          of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies
          horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
          German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu",
          The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right
          hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist
          to get ready).

          

          

          

          
          As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna
          stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR...

          WHEN...

          SILVER SCREEN
          the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the
          one).

          SHOSANNA
          THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from
          projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
          As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva
          MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans
          up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
          Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
          LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
          obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          To operate a cinema in Paris during
          the occupation, one had two choices.
          Ether you could show new German propaganda
          films, produced under the watchful
          eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
          could have a German night in your
          weekly schedule, and show allowed
          German classic films.
          Their German night was Thursday.
          Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
          the letters on the marquee.
          A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
          out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
          girl on top, and walks over.
          They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          What starts tomorrow?
          Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
          at her from below.

          

          

          

          

          LC 3.

          SHOSANNA
          A Max Linder festival.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
          Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
          film as good as "The Rid". The chase
          climax of "The Kid", superb.
          Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I suppose now you could use a "M"
          a "A" and a "X"?

          SHOSANNA
          No need, I can manage.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure.
          He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I adore your cinema very much.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.
          She busies herself with the marquee letters...

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          How does a young girl, such as yourself,
          own a cinema?
          Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
          at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
          hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          My aunt left it to me.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Lucky girl.
          Shosanna makes no reply back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Merci for hoisting a German night.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't have a choice, but your welcome.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Do you chose the German films yourself?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Then my merci stands. I love the
          Refensthal mountain films, especially,
          "Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French
          girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.

          SHOSANNA
          "Admire", would not be the adjective
          I would use to describe my feelings
          towards Fraulein Refensthal.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          But you do admire the director. Pabst,
          don't you? That's why you included
          his name on the marquee.
          She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
          Private.

          SHOSANNA
          I'm French. We respect directors
          in our country.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Apparently even Germans.

          SHOSANNA
          Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
          Private. Adieu.
          She turns to go back inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Your not finished?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          I'll finish in the morning.
          She opens the door to go inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          May I ask your name?

          SHOSANNA
          You wish to see my papers?
          She hands him her excellently forged papers.
          That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
          to read her name.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
          pretty name.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
          He hands them back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
          She gives no response.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          It's been a pleasure chatting with a
          fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
          Mademoiselle.
          He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
          curfew imposed night.
          She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
          her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
          anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

          EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
          Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
          lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
          she remembers a voice.

          FLASH ON
          MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
          projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
          lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
          HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
          quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

          

          

          

          
          If-7.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          if I ever see you light up a cigarette
          in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
          the Nazi's, do you understand?
          Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          And for bringing a open flame in my
          cinema, you deserve far worse then
          a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
          head, what do you think the highest
          priority of a cinema manager is?
          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,
          35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
          not only immensely flammable, but
          highly unstable. And should they
          catch fire, they burn three times
          faster then paper. If that happens..
          .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
          every body burned alive. If I ever
          see you with a open flame in my cinema
          again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
          I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
          Germans will give me a curfew pass.
          Do you understand me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Do you believe me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          You damn well better.

          BACK TO ROOF
          Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
          Marcel comes onto the roof.

          MARCEL
          Are you well?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Even on the roof I can't smoke a
          cigarette without hearing Madames
          voice yelling at me. That's why I
          do it. To hear Madames voice again.

          MARCEL
          We both miss her.

          SHOSANNA
          I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
          to bed soon.
          Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

          INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
          Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
          book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
          wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
          FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
          French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
          to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
          Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          May I join you?

          SHOSANNA
          Look Fredrick -

          FREDRICK

          (SMILING)
          - You remember my name?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -

          FREDRICK
          - Merci.

          SHOSANNA
          Your welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.

          FREDRICK
          I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't wish to be your friend.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Why not?

          SHOSANNA
          Don't act like a infant. You know why.

          FREDRICK
          I'm more then just a uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          Not to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.

          SHOSANNA
          Who are you?

          FREDRICK
          I thought I was just a uniform?

          SHOSANNA
          Your not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?

          FREDRICK
          Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

          SHOSANNA
          Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

          FREDRICK
          Yes.

          SHOSANNA
          Really?

          FREDRICK
          No not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.

          SHOSANNA
          Then what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?

          

          

          

          

          6'O

          FREDRICK
          Not exactly.

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.

          FREDRICR
          When you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.

          FREDRICR
          I come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          You were raised by Helga?

          FREDRICK
          All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.

          SHOSANNA
          And your mother and father?

          FREDRICK
          My mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.

          SHOSANNA
          is your cinema still operatiing?

          FREDRICR
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          What's it called?

          

          

          

          

          5!

          FREDRICK
          The Kino Haus.

          SHOSANNA
          How has it done durring the war?

          FREDRICK
          Actually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.

          SHOSANNA
          No doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.

          FREDRICK
          How often do you fill your house?

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), not since before the war.

          FREDRICK
          So if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

          SHOSANNA
          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

          FREDRICK
          Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

          SHOSANNA
          What did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.

          FREDRICK
          I've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

          SHOSANNA
          Wow.

          

          

          

          

          52

          FREDRICK
          I was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.

          SHOSANNA
          What's a bird's nest?

          FREDRICK
          A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

          SHOSANNA
          How many Russian's did you kill?

          FREDRICK
          Sixty-eight.

          (BEAT)
          The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.

          SHOSANNA
          Maybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.

          FREDRICK
          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.

          SHOSANNA
          "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?

          FREDRICK
          I know, comical, huh?

          SHOSANNA
          Not so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?

          

          

          

          

          53.

          FREDRICK
          Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Well, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.

          EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
          It's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.

          WHEN...
          .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
          Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
          Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.

          

          

          

          
          5 q.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Mademoiselle Nimieux?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui?
          Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Ask her if this is her cinema?
          in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

          DRIVER
          is this your cinema?

          SHOSANNA

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Tell her to come down.

          DRIVER
          Come down please.
          She climbs down the ladder.
          The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
          to get in.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't understand, what have I done?

          DRIVER
          (to Major)
          She wants to know what she's done?

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Who says she's done anything?

          DRIVER
          Who says you've done anything?
          Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

          SHOSANNA
          Then I demand to know what this is about,
          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;

          

          

          

          

          55.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Get your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
          followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

          INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
          The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
          streets.

          WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
          the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
          her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

          EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;
          They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GOEBBELS
          - it's only the off spring of slaves that
          allows America to be competitive athletically.
          America olympic gold can measured in Negro
          sweat.
          Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
          not you'd except my invitation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Invitation?

          THEN...
          .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;

          GOEBBLES(OS)
          Is that the young lady in question,
          Fredrick?
          Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
          arm, and leads her to him.

          FREDRICK
          Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.

          FREDRICK
          Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
          introduce you to the minister of
          propaganda, the leader of the entire
          German film industry, and now I'm a
          actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
          Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
          shake. She does.

          GOEBBELS
          Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
          Mimieux.
          He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big
          bite of terri misu.
          They all laugh.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
          interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca
          Mondino.

          FRANCESCA
          looks up at Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          5'?
          NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack;

          NARRATOR (VO)
          Francesca Mondino is much more then
          Goebbels French Interpreter.
          She's also Goebbels favorite French
          actress to appear in his films...

          FLASH ON:

          FILM CLIP
          from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions.
          Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG

          GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
          She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH;

          FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
          I love you, I can't help it. My country
          or my heart, which do I betray?
          A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title;

          DOGGY STYLE.

          FRANCESCA

          (ANIMAL-LIKE)
          Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!

          BACK TO FRANCESCA
          looking at Shosanna.

          FRANCESCA
          Bon jour.

          SHOSANNA
          Bon jour.

          

          

          

          

          I
          f.

          FREDRICK
          And you've met the Major.
          The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
          (to Shosanna)
          Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at
          your service mademoiselle.
          (he clicks
          his heels)
          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
          Goebbels looks across the table at her.

          GOEBBELS
          well I must say, you've made quite a
          impression on our boy.
          Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

          GOEBBELS
          I must say fraulein, I should be rather
          annoyed with you.
          Francesca interprets..

          GOEBBELS
          I arrive in France, and I wish to have
          lunch with my star...
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Little do I know Be's become
          the toast of paris, and now he
          must find time for me.
          Francesca interprets...

          

          

          

          
          c9 â€¢

          GOEBBELS
          People wait in line hours, day's,
          to see me. For the Fuhrer and
          Private Zoller, I wait.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So finally, I'm granted a audience
          with the young Private, and he spends
          the entire lunch speaking of you
          and your cinema.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
          to business.
          Private Zoller interrupts -

          FREDRICK
          - Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
          her yet.

          GOEBBELS
          Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
          sure she's figured it out by now,
          after all she does operate a cinema.
          Francesca, tell her.
          Francesca tells Shosanna in French;

          FRANCESCA
          What they're trying to tell you
          Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
          spent the last hour at lunch,
          trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
          to abandon previous plans for Private
          Zollers film premier, and change the
          venue to your cinema.
          Zoller reacts.

          FRANCESCA

          (FRENCH
          to Zoller)
          What?

          FREDRICK
          I wanted to inform her.

          FRANCESCA
          Shit. I apologize Private, of
          course you did.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          GOEBBELS

          (GERMAN
          to Francesca)
          What's the issue?

          FRANCESCA
          The Private wanted to inform the
          mademoiselle himself.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense. Until I ask a few
          questions, he has nothing to inform.
          Let the record state, I have not
          agreed to a venue change.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Duly noted.
          Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;

          GOEBBELS
          You have opera boxes?

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS
          More would be better. How many
          seats in your auditorium?

          SHOSANNA
          Three hundred and fifty.

          GOEBBELS
          That's almost four hundred less
          then The Ritz.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          But beer Goebbels, that's not such
          a terrible thing. You said yourself
          you didn't want to indulge every
          two faced french bourgeois taking
          up space currying favor. With less
          seat's it makes the event more
          exclusive. Your not trying to fill
          the house, their fightin g for seats.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          FREDRICK

          (CON'T)
          Besides, to hell with the French.
          This is a German night, a German
          event, a German celebration. This
          night is for you, me, the German
          military, the high command, their
          family and friends. The only people
          who should be allowed in the room,
          are people who will be moved by
          the exploits on screen.
          Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

          GOEBBELS
          I see your public speaking has
          improved. It appears I've created
          a monster. A strangely persuasive
          monster. When the war's over,
          politics awaits.
          Table chuckles.

          GOEBBELS
          Well Private, though it is true,
          I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
          I must watch a film in this young
          ladies cinema before I can say,
          yes or no.
          (to Shosanna)
          So young lady, you are to close
          your cinema tonight, and have
          a private screening me.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          What German films do you have?
          Francesca asks..

          SHOSANNA
          My cinema , on German night, tends
          to show older German classics.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Why not my films?
          Francesca asks...

          

          

          

          

          6Z.

          SHOSANNA
          I draw a older German audience in
          my cinema, that appreciate the
          nostalgia of the earlier time.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
          are looking forward, not backwards.
          That era of German cinema is dead.
          The German cinema I create, will not
          only be thee cinema of Europe. But
          the worlds only alternative to the
          degenerate Jewish influence of
          Hollywood.
          Fredrick Jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          Along with being a cinema owner,
          Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
          film critic.
          He chuckles, but alone.

          GOEBBELS
          WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
          for the fraulein, I've outlawed
          film criticism.
          Zoller, thinking fast, says;

          FREDRICK
          Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
          I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
          And it's so funny, I've been meaning
          to recommend it to her, for her
          German night. That's a great idea,
          let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          GOEBBELS
          Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
          "Lucky Kids". When all is said and
          done, my most purely enjoyable
          production. Not only that, I
          wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
          years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
          that I'm the most remembered for.
          I know it doesn't seem like it now,
          but mark my words.
          Very well, I'll have a print sent
          over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
          We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          

          

          

          

          63
          As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
          ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
          filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

          GOEBBELS
          Ah Landa, your here, this is the
          young lady in question.
          The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
          first scene COL HANS LANDA.

          FREDRICK
          Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
          the SS., he'll be running security
          for the premier.

          CU SHOSANNA
          A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
          gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
          The S.S. OFFICER
          that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
          saying in perfect French;

          COL LANDA
          Charmed Mademoiselle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
          The table laughs.

          GOEBBELS
          Oh Francesca, what was that funny
          thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

          FRANCESCA
          What thing?

          GOEBBELS
          You know, you were there, it was a
          funny thing the Fuhrer said,
          about Hans...Something about a pig?
          Francesca's memory is jogged.

          FRANCESCA
          Oh, yes of course.
          She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.

          

          

          

          

          6 "F

          GOEBBELS
          Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
          the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
          surprised if Hans weren't rooting
          out Jews like a truffle pig from
          the play pen.

          FRANCESCA
          That's what we need, pigs that can
          root out Jews.

          COL LANDA
          Who needs pigs when you have me?
          Big hearty laugh around the table.

          GOEBBELS
          Do you have a engagement tonight?

          COL LANDA
          Well, as a matter of fact, I do -

          GOEBBELS
          - Break it. We're all going to the
          Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
          "Lucky Kids".

          COL LANDA
          Splendid.
          Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,

          INTERRUPTS;

          FRANCESCA
          And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
          to his next appointment.

          GOEBBELS
          Slave driver! French slave driver!
          They all chuckle.
          Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
          ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
          .as Col Landa stands, he says;

          COL LANDA
          Actually, in my role as security
          chief of this joyous German occasion,
          I'm afraid I must have a word with
          Mademoiselle Mimieux.

          

          

          

          

          C. 5.
          Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

          FREDRICK
          What sort of discussion?

          COL LANDA
          That sounded suspiciously like a
          Private questioning the order of a
          Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

          FREDRICK
          Nothing could be further from the
          truth Colonel. Your authority is
          beyond question.
          But your reputation does proceed
          you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
          or myself be concerned?

          GOEBBELS
          Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
          simply smitten. And he's correct.
          Your reputation does proceed you.
          Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
          make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
          a leash, leading the way.

          COL LANDA
          No need for concern, you two.
          As security chief, I simply need
          to have a chat with the possible
          new venue's property owner.

          FREDRICK
          I was just hoping to escort
          Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
          cinema.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
          and walk along the Sienne another
          time. Right now, allow Col Landa
          to do his job.
          Everybody saystheir farewells.
          Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
          table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
          The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
          french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
          french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
          simply a interrogation-technique.

          

          

          

          
          bd.
          They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Have you tried the strudel here?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          COL LANDA
          It's not so terrible. So how is it
          the young Private and yourself came
          to be acquainted?
          She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.

          COL LANDA
          Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
          and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
          of espresso, with a container of.
          steamed milk, on the side.
          For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
          Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
          she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
          entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
          least... . disconcerting.
          The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
          side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
          your secrets.

          COL LANDA
           So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
          to explain....?

          SHOSANNA

          (ANXIOUSLY)
          Up untill a couple of days ago,
          I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
          or his exploits. To me, the Private
          was simply just a patron of my cinema.
          We spoke a few times, but -

          COL LANDA
          - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
          This is a simple formality, no
          reason for you to feel anxious.
          The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;

          

          

          

          

          67

          COL LANDA
          I apologize, I forgot to order the
          cream fresh.

          WAITER
          One moment.
          He exits.

          COL LANDA
          (Refuring to
          the apple pie)
          Wait for the cream.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So Emmanuelle - May I call you
          Emmanuelle?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
          does it happen, that a young lady
          such as your self, comes to own a
          cinema?
          The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
          The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
          up his fork, he says;

          COL LANDA
          After you.
          Shosanna takes â€¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her
          lead.

          COL LANDA

          (MOUTHFULL
          of pie)
          Success?
          Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.

          .COL LANDA
          Like I said, not so terrible.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So you were explaining the origin of
          your cinema ownership?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          SHOSANNA
          The cinema originally belonged to
          my aunt and uncle -
          Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.

          COL LANDA
          - What is there names?

          SHOSANNA
          Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
          He records the names in his little book.

          COL LANDA
          Where are they now?

          SHOSANNA
          My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.

          COL LANDA
          Pity... . Continue.

          SHOSANNA
          Aunt Ada passed away from fever
          last spring.'

          COL LANDA
          Regrettable.

          (RESPECTFUL

          PAUSE)
          It's come to my attention you have
          a negro in your employ, is that true?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
          Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
          uncle since they opened the cinema.
          He's the only other one who works
          with me.

          COL LANDA
          Doing what?

          SHOSANNA
          Projectionist.

          COL LANDA
          Is he any good?

          SHOSANNA
          The best.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          COL LANDA
          Actually one could see where that
          might be a good trade for them.
          Can you operate the projectors?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course I can.

          COL LANDA
          Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
          I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
          the success or failure of his
          illustrious evening, dependent on
          the prowess of a negro. So if it
          comes to pass we hold this event
          at your venue, talented no doubt,
          as your negro may be, you will
          operate the projectors. Is that
          exceptable?
          As if she has any say.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.
          Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

          COL LANDA
          So it would appear our young hero is
          quite smitten with you?

          SHOSANNA
          Private Zollers feelings for me
          aren't of a romantic nature.

          COL LANDA
          Mademoiselle...?

          SHOSANNA
          Colonel, his feelings are not
          romantic. I remind him of his sister.

          COL LANDA
          That doesn't mean his feelings
          aren't romantic.

          SHOSANNA
          I remind him of his sister who
          raised him.

          

          

          

          

          70

          COL LANDA
          It's sounding more and more romantic
          by the minute.
          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

          COL LANDA
          Cigarette?

          SHOSANNA
          No thank you.

          COL LANDA
          Do you smoke?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Then I insist, you must take one.
          There not French, there German.
          I hope your not nationalist about
          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;

          COL LANDA
          I did have some thing else I wanted
          to ask you, but right now, for the
          life of me, I can't remember what it
          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:

          COL LANDA
          Till tonight.
          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
          feet.

          

          

          

          

          7 1.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The SILVER SCREEN
          on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".
          We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.

          CU GOEBBELS
          Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

          CU FRANCESCA
          Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

          CU TWO BLACK POODLES
          Pantingly watching the screen.

          CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Smiling, smoking a French cigarette.

          CU COL LANDA
          Smoking his calabash, amused.

          CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
          Truly enjoying himself.

          CU SHOSANNA
          watching the screen.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          While Shosanna sits there pretending
          to be amused by the aryan antics of
          Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
          Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
          her.
          We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          What if tonight, accidently, the
          cinema burned down? The Third Reich
          would lose it's Minister of
          propaganda, it's national hero, and
          it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
          swoop.
          She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
          laughing at the German comedy.

          SILVER SCREEN
          "The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
          The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.

          

          

          

          

          IZ
          The lights go up.

          P
          Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
          file out into the lobby.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

          GOEBBELS
          I must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.

          MONTAGE
          we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

          SHOSANNA
          watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
          disbelief.

          

          

          

          

          73

          BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "S
          in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
          escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          As they left the little French
          cinema that night, all the Germans
          were very happy...
          We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          None more so then Private Zoller.
          She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the
          Paris night. Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look
          like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
          The Nazi's are gone.
          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          What the fuck are we suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          It looks like we're suppose to have
          a Nazi premier.

          MARCEL
          Like I said, what the fuck are we
          suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          Well, I need to speak with you
          about that.

          MARCEL
          About what?

          SHOSANNA
          About these Hun swine, commandeering
          our cinema.

          MARCEL
          What about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Well, when I was watching the bosch
          (Said in

          ENGLISH)
          Capra-corn abomination,
          (Back to

          FRENCH)
          I got a idea.

          MARCEL
          I'm confused, what are we talking
          about?

          SHOSANNA
          Filling the cinema with Nazi's and
          their whores, and burning it down
          to the ground.

          MARCEL
          I'm not talking about that, your
          talking about that.

          SHOSANNA
          No, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.

          MARCEL
          Shosanna -

          SHOSANNA
          No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?

          MARCEL
          Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

          SHOSANNA
          And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
          film print collection, we wouldn't
          even need explosives, would we?

          MARCEL
          You mean we wouldn't need any more
          explosives?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
          She begins kissing his hands.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          I am going to burn down the cinema
          on Nazi night.
          One of his fingers probes her mouth.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          And if I'm going to burn down the
          cinema, which I am, we both know,
          your not going to let me do it
          by myself.
          The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
          both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          Because you love me. And I love you.
          And your the only person on this earth
          I can trust.
          She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
          face to face.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          But that's not all we're going to do.
          Does the filmmaking equipment it the
          attic still work? I know the film
          camera does. How about the sound
          recorder?

          MARCEL
          Quite well, actually. I recorded a
          new guitarist I met in a cafe last
          week. It works superb. Why do we
          need filmmaking equipment?

          SHOSANNA
          Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
          going to make a film. Just for the
          Nazi's.

          FADE OFF

          INT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY
          A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors
          that serve as a entrance to the room.

          MILITARY ATTACHE
          Right this way, Lieutenant.
          A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
          the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
          the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
          A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
          Bel Ami, years).
          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
          Dammed).
          But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
          smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
          bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

          LT. HICOX
          Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.

          GEN FENECH
          (Salutes back)
          General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
          Drink?
          Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
          who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
          the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
          acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
          Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
          introduced, he ain't there.

          LT.HICOX
          if you offered me a scotch and plane
          water, I could drink a scotch and
          plain water.

          

          

          

          

          ?7.

          GEN.FENECH
          That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
          yourself, like a good chap,
          will you? Bars in the globe.
          Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

          LT.HICOX
          Something for yourself, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
          The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
          busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
          Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you've run three
          undercover commando operations in
          Germany, and German occupied
          territories? Frankfaurt, Holland,
          and Norway to be exact?
          Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;

          LT.HICOX
          Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you speak German fluently?

          LT.HICOX
          Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

          GEN.FENECH
          And your occupation before the war?
          His back still to us, as he bartends...

          LT. H I COX
          I'm a film critic.

          GEN.FENECH
          List your accomplishments?

          LT.HICOX
          Well sir, such as they are, I write
          reviews and articles, for a publication
          called; "Films and Filmmakers".
          As well as our sister publication.

          

          

          

          
          7f .

          GEN.FENECH
          What's that called?

          LT.HICOX
          "Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
          two books published.

          GEN.FENECH
          Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
          what are their titles?

          LT. HI COX
          The first book was called; "Art Of The
          Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
          of German Cinema in the Twenties".
          And the second one was called; ...
          He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
          Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
          he walks toward the General, handing him his drink.

          LT.HICOX
          "Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
          It's a subtexual film criticism
          study of the work of German director
          G.W. Pabst.

          LT. HI COX
          What should we drink to, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          (Thinking, for
          a moment)
          Down with Hitler.

          LT.HICOX
          All the way down, sir.

          GEN.FENECH
          Are you familiar with German cinema
          under the Third Reich?

          LT. HI COX
          Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
          the films made in the last three
          years, but I am familiar with it.

          GEN.FENECH
          Explain it to me.?

          

          

          

          

          77

          LT.HICOX
          Pardon sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          This little escapade of ours,
          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

          LT.HICOX
          Goebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.
          SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

          CHURCHELL
          How's he doing?

          LT. H I COX
          Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

          CHURCHELL
          You say he wants to take on the Jews
          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

          LT.HICOX
          Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
          closer to David O.Selznick.
          Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
          With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

          CHURCHELL
          Brief him.

          GEM.FENECH
          Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
          like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
          Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
          throwing a gala premier of one of his
          new movies in Paris -

          

          

          

          

          80.

          LT.HICOX
          - What film sir?
          The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

          GEN.FENECH
          The motion pictures called; "Nation's
          Pride".

          LT.HICOX
          Oh, you mean the film about Private
          Zoller?

          GEN.FENECH
          We don't have any intelligence, on
          exactly, what the film that night
          will be about.

          LT.HICOX
          But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

          GEN.FENECH
          Yes.

          LT.HICOX
          I can tell you what it's about,
          it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
          He's the German Sgt.York.
          Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

          GEN.FENECH
          In attendance at this joyous Germatic
          occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
          Boorman, and most of the German High
          command, including all high ranking
          officers of both The S.S., and, The
          Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
          Nazi propaganda film industry.

          LT.HICOX
          The master race at play, aye?

          GEN.FENECH
          Basically, we have all our rotten
          eggs in one basket. The objective of
          Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

          LT.HICOX
          (Reciting a
          a poem)
          "...and like the snows of yesteryear,
          gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.

          

          

          

          

          GEN.FENECH
          An American Secret Service outfit,
          that lives deep behind enemy lines,
          will be your assist. The Germans call
          them; "The Basterds".

          LT.HICOX
          "The Basterds", never heard of them.

          GEN.FENECH
          Whole point of the secret service,
          old boy, you not hearing of them.
          But the Gerrys have heard of them,
          because these yanks have been them
          the devil. Their leader is a chap
          named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
          call him, "Aldo the Apache".

          LT.HICOX
          Why do they call him that?

          GEN.FENECH
          Best guess, is because he removes the
          scalps of the Nazi dead.

          LT.HICOX
          Scalps, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          The hair.
          He runs his finger along his hairline.

          GEN.FENECH
          Like a red Injun.

          LT.HICOX
          Rather gruesome sounding little
          Dicky bird, isn't he?

          GEN.FENECH
          No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
          nutters. But you've heard the
          expression, "It takes a thief".

          LT.HICOX
          Indeed.
          General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
          to a military map.

          

          

          

          
          9i.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll be dropped into France, about
          twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
          The Basterds will be waiting for you.
          First thing, you go to a little village
          called, "Nadine".
          (He points it
          out on the map)
          Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
          In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
          "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
          with our double agent, and she'll take
          it from there. She's the one who's
          going to get you in the premiere.
          It will be you, her, and two German
          born members of the Basterds. She's
          also made all the other arrangements
          your going to need.

          LT.HICOX
          How will I know her?

          GEN.FENECH
          I suspect that won't be too much
          trouble for you. Your contact is
          Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          LT.HICOX
          Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
          movie star is working for England?

          GEN.FENECH
          For the last two years now. one could
          even say Operation Kino was her
          brainchild.
          In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

          CHURCHELL
          Extraordinary women.

          LT.BICOX
          Quite.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll go to the premiere as her
          escort, lucky devil. She'll also
          have the premiere tickets for the
          other two. Got the gist?

          LT.HICOX
          I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
          The three British bulldogs laugh.

          

          

          

          

          9 3

          EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY
           Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema,
          literally, making a movie.
          Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
          positioned low looking up.
           Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
          into it.
          A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
          As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
          SUBTITLED into you know what.

          MARCEL
          We need a sync mark.

          SHOSANNA
          What is a sync mark?

          MARCEL
          A action and noise put together,
          So we can sync up the picture
          and sound.

          SHOSANNA
          How do we do that?

          MARCEL
          Clap your hands.
          She does.

          MARCEL
          In frame imbecile.
          She claps her hands in front of her face.

          MARCEL
          Ready?
          Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;

          SHOSANNA
          Ready.

          MARCEL
          Action.

          WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO...

          

          

          

          

          GIR

          .THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

          LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
          Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR.

          MARCEL
          But how do we get it developed?
          Only a suicidal idiot like us would
          develop that footage. How do we get
          a35mm print with a soundtrack?

          SHOSANNA
          Do you know one person who can do
          both things?

          MARCEL
          Of course Gaspar, very nice man,
          took care of all the experimental
          filmmakers. But nobody in their
          right mind would strike a print of
          what your talking about. If the
          Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't
          be worth this.
          He snaps his fingers.

          SHOSANNA
          In a wolf fight, you ether eat the
          wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're
          going to obliterate the Nazi's,
          we have to use their tactics.

          MARCEL
          What does that mean?

          SHOSANNA
          We find somebody who can develop
          and process a35mm print. And we
          make them do it, or we kill them.
          Once we tell them what we want to
          do, if they refuse, we have to kill
          them anyway, or they'll turn us in.

          MARCEL
          Would you do that?

          SHOSANNA
          Like that.
          Snaps her fingers.

          INT - SMALL FILM PROCESSING LAB- LATE NIGHT
          A old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties.
          Late late at night.
          GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
          filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE
          BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
          Shosanna watches, pitiless.

          SHOSANNA
          Bring that fucker over here!
          Put his head down on that table.
          Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat
          against the table top.
          Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
          his face.

          SHOSANNA
          You ether do what the fuck we tell
          you to, or I'll bury this axe in your
          collaborating skull.

          GASPAR
          I'm not a collaborator!

          SHOSANNA
          Then prove it! Or does your manhood
          go no deeper, then standing to piss?
          Marcel, does his wife, and children
          know you?

          MARCEL
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          Then after we kill this dog for
          Germans, we'll go and silence them.
          She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...

          SHOSANNA
          Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

          CUT TO

          GASPAR
          hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside
          the shop window, it's morning.

          

          

          

          

          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH-
          WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers
          life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of
          the projection booth.
          The can for REEL 4is open and empty.
          Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the
          rewinds...
          Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of
          Fredricks film. Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
          puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN.
          She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
          her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

          BLACK FRAME

          FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT
          We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out
          front that reads, "La Louisiane".

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
          "The Village of

          NADINE, FRANCE"
          TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
          Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
          German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
          apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

          LT.ALDO
          You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
          was in a fuckin basement.

          LT.HICOX
          I didn't know.

          LT.ALDO
          You said it was in a tavern?

          LT.HICOX
          it is a tavern.

          

          

          

          

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, in a basement. You know,
          fightin in a basement offers a lot
          of difficulties, number one being,
          your fighting in a basement.
          Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
          Lieutenant uniform.

          WICKI
          What if we go in there, and she's
          not even there?

          LT.HICOX
          We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
          spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
          WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
          are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
          and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
          uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
          sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
          boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
          chapter, is dead.
          Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
          the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
          .Stiglitz is fucking werid...
          Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

          LT.NICOX
          Stiglitz, right?

          STIGLITZ
          That's right, sir.
          He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
          leather strap.

          LT.HICOX
          I hear your pretty good with that?
          Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

          LT.HICOX
          You know, we're not looking for
          trouble, right now. We're simply
          making contact with our agent.
          Should be uneventful. However, on
          the off chance I'm wrong, and things
          prove eventful. I need to know, we can
          all remain calm.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
          looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

          STIGLITZ
          I don't look calm to you?

          LT.HICOX
          Well, now you put it like that,
          I guess you do.
          He turns his attention back to his blade.
          Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

          LT. HI COX
          This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
          Not exactly the loquacious type,
          is he?
          Aldo just looks at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Is that the kinds man you need, the
          loquacious type?

          LT.HICOX
          Fair point, Lieutenant.

          LT.ALDO
          So y'all git in trouble in there,
          what are we suppose to do?
          Make bets on how it all comes out?

          LT.HICOX
          If we get into trouble, we can
          handle it. But if trouble does
          happen, we need you to make damn
          sure no Germans, or French, for
          matter, escape from that basement.
          If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
          compromised, the mission is kaput.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
          who's idea was it for the death trap
          redez-vous?

          LT.HICOX
          She chose the spot.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Well isn't that just dandy?

          

          

          

          

          LT.HICOX
          Look, she's not a military strategist.
          She's just a actress.

          LT.ALDO
          Ya don't got to be Stonewall
          Jackson to know you don't want to
          fight in a basement.

          LT.HICOX
          She wasn't picking a place to fight.
          She was picking a place, isolated,
          and without germans.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
          but I got me a Nazi pissin on
          Louisianna two-o'clock.
          They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
          PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
          Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

          LT.HICOX
          Shit.
          Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          So what do you think your fraulein
          Von Hammer -

          LT.HICOX
          - Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
          The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
          suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
          window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
          in hand.

          STIGLITZ
          If we're going, let's go.
          He sheaths the dagger.

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
          The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
          Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
          that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...

          

          

          

          INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
          .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
          hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
          right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
          up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
          half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
          the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
          Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
          five.

          FIVE NAZI'S
          ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
          stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
          The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
          playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
          the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
          nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
          fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
          a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
          out who they are.
           The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

          FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),

          GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
           (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
          the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
          It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
           The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
          Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
          Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
          of their game playing, and celebrating.

          WINNETOU
          .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
          The whole table bursts out laughing.

          FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
          Yes you arel

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well, not really.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          What do you mean, not really? Of
          course he is.

          

          

          

          

          91

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well if he's so American, how come
          he's never been translated into
          English? He's not American. He's
          suppose to be American, but he's not
          a American creation. In fact, he's
          something very different.

          WINNETOU
          Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
          character, from the past, I'm American,
          and that's controversial.

          BRIDGET/GENGUS
          No it's not controversial. The nationally
          of the author, has nothing to do with
          the nationally of the character.
          The Character is the character.
          Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
          So yes, this character was born in
          America.

          WINNETOU
          Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
          a wife, would she be called a squaw?
          He's got it.
          The table Laughs.
          The TABLE

          YES!

          WINNETOU
          Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
          The TABLE
          Yes!

          WINNETOU
          Did Karl May write me?
          The TABLE
          Yes!
          In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
          Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
          tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
          too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
          doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
          see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

          

          

          

          

          QZ

          BRIDGET
          Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
          in moments. I'm finishing up a game
          with my five new friends here.

          LT.HICOX
          No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
          Take your time, enjoy yourself.

          BRIDGET
          (To Winnetou)
          So who are you?

          WINNETOU
          I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
          The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
          the card off his forehead.
          The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
          the game).
          Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

          MATA HARI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
          friends came in, did you realize
          you did a double take, like in the
          movies?

          BRIDGET
          Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
          at all.

          MATA HARI
          They must be second nature to you now?
          Did they teach you how to do a double
          take in the movies?

          BRIDGET
          Well, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Do one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.

          

          

          

          
          q3.

          MATA HARI
          My turn, I want to try.
          Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
          Take.

          EDGER WALLACE
          I want to try.
          He does.
          Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

          HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
          watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
          understand.

          THEN...
          .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

          BRIDGET
          Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          LT.HICOX
          I thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?

          BRIDGET
          Normally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.

          WICXI
          We should leave.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          F No, we should stay. For one drink at
          least. I've been waiting for you in a
          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.

          LT.HICOX
          She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.

          BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
          The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

          NAPOLEON.
          The Germans all laugh.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE

          BRIDGET
          There's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.

          LT.HICOX
          Why?

          BRIDGET
          No one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
          They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.

          

          

          

          

          9

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BRIDGET
          (To Hicox)
          You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
          You'll say your a associate producer
          on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
          one German production not under Goebbels
          control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
          at a Goebbels film affair.

          BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
          Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
          dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
          the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
          head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

          BRIDGET
          .the films gone through many delays,
          and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
          if you have to speak...
          Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
          to cool it.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
          thinking, could you sign a autograph
          to my son on his birthday?

          BRIDGET
          I'd love to Wilhelm.
          (To the Table)
          This handsome happy Sgt, just became
          a father today.
          The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
          The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
          superior officers.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, heil Hitler.
          He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
          Hitler".
          As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

          BRIDGET
          So Wilhelm, do you know the name of
          this progeny yet?

          

          

          

          

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I most certainly do, fraulein. His
          name is Maximilian.
          Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.

          STIGLITZ
          Wonderful name, Sgt.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
          enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
          him a blue one. And I will paint on
          the side "The Blue Max".
          He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
          They do.
          Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

          BRIDGET
          There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.

          BRIDGET
          Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
          not know who you are now. But he will.
          I will show him all of your movies.
          He will grow up with your films,
          and this napkin on his wall.
          Then, to the whole tavern...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
          in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
          no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
          The whole room toasts.
          This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
          table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
          drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
          you to France?

          

          

          

          

          97 .
          Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
          exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.

          LT.HICOX
          None of your business,Sgt.
          You might not have worn out your welcome
          with the fraulein, with your drunken
          boorish behavior, but you have wore out
          your welcome with me.
          The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.

          LT.HICOX
          Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
          man. This is a officers table. I suggest
          you stop pestering the fraulein, and
          rejoin your table.
          The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is
          is very unusual.
          The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Where are you from?
          A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
          German born impostors spring into action.

          WICKI
          Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,
          to speak to a superior officer with
          such impertinentness!
          Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;

          STIGLITZ
          I'm making YOU,...
          (Pointing at

          WINNETOU)
          .and YOU,..
          (Pointing at
          Edgar Wallace)
          .responsible, for him.
          (Pointing at
          Sgt.Pola)
          I suggest you take hold of your friend,
          or he'll spend Max's first birthday
          in jail for public drunkenness!

          

          

          

          

          78
          The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola...

          1W

          WHEN...
          A GERMAN VOICE rings out;

          GERMAN VOICE (OS)
          Then might I inquire?
          The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
          in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
          MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
          the little table he was sitting at.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Like the young newly christened father,
          I too have a acute ear for accents.
          And like him, I too find yours odd.
          From where do you hail, Cap't?
          Wicki jumps in;

          WICKI
          Major, this is highly inappr -

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          T wasn't speaking to you
          Lt.Saltzberg,
          (Turning to

          STIGLITZ)
          or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
          (Looking at

          HICOX)
          I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
          The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
          impostors table.
          Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

          LT.HICOX
          I was born in the village that rests
          in the shadow of Piz Palu.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          The mountain?

          LT.HICOX
          Yes. In that village we all speak like
          this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes.

          

          

          

          
          f q s

          LT. HICOX
          Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
          torch scene?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes I do.

          LT.HICOX
          In that scene was myself, my father,
          my sister, and my two brothers. My
          brother is so handsome, the director
          Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
          cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
          she says;

          BRIDGET
          Major, if my word means anything, I can
          vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
          just said. He does hail from the bottom
          of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
          and his brother is far more handsome
          then he.
          The impostors laugh.
          Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          You should rejoin your friends.
          Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
          begins playing there game again.
          Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
          graciously to the female German celebrity.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          May I join you?

          BRIDGET
          By all means, Major.
          The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
          Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So that's the source of your bazaar
          accent? Extraordinary. So what are
          you doing here Cap't?

          LT.HICOX
          Aside from having a drink with the lovely
          fraulein?

          

          

          

          

          ,00 .

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
          Chuckle...Chuckle

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I mean in country. Your obviously not
          stationed in France, or I'd know who
          you are.

          LT â€¢ I'! I COX
          You know every German in France?

          MAJOR BELLSTROM
          Worth knowing.

          LT.HICOX
          Well, there in lies the problem. We
          never claimed to be worth knowing.
          Chuckle... Chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          (Chuckling as
          he asks)
          All levity aside, what are you doing
          in France?

          LT.HICOX
          Attending Goebbels film premiere as
          the frauleins escort.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Your the frauleins escort?

          LT.HICOX
          Somebody has to carry the lighter.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          BRIDGET
          The Captain is my date, but all three
          are my guests. We're old friends Major,
          who go back along time. Longer then
          a actress would care to admit.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well, in that case, let me raise a glass
          to the three luckiest men in the room.

          BRIDGET
          I'll drink to that.

          

          

          

          

          101
          They cheers.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
          They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.

          BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I must say, that game their playing
          looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
          join them, because your quite right Cap't,
          officers and enlisted men shouldn't
          fraternize. But seeing as we're all
          officers here,
          (Bowing to

          BRIDGET)
          .and sophisticated lady friends of
          officers. What say we play the game?
          Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
          better), interrupts him;

          BRIDGET
          okay, one game.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          WUNDERBAR
          The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
          them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.
          Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
          instance, you could write Confucius or
          Fu Manchu.
          (He SNAPS his

          FINGERS)
          Eric' More pens.
          (Back to players)
          And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
          When you finish writing, put the card
          face down on the table, and move it to
          the person to your left. The person to
          your right, will move their card in
          front of you. You pick up the card
          without looking at it, lick the back,
          and stick it on your forehead like so.
          He demonstrates.

          

          

          

          
          )oz.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          (CON'T)
          And in ten yes or no questions, you must
          guess who you are...
          As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
          game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
          STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
          Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
          FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
          The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
          this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
          it.
          The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          .So let's give it a try, shall we?
          Everybody write your names.
          The Five players write their names...
          Then move their cards to the right...
          Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

          Am I German?
          They laugh.

          No.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Am I a American?
          They laugh - but then Wicki says;

          born in America.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          So... . I visited America, aye?
          The Table says; "Yes".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Was this vist...fortuitous?

          WICKI
          Not for you.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          .Bummm. My native land, is it what
          one would call, exotic?
          The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Hummmm. That could be ether a reference
          to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going
          to let my first instinct take over, and
          ask, am I from the jungle?
          The Tablesays; "Yes you are".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Now gentlemen, around this time you could
          ask, weather your real or fictitious.
          I however, think that's too easy, so I
          won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land
          is the jungle? I visited America, but my
          visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
          implication is that it was to somebody
          else. When I went from the jungle to
          America,... .Did I go by boat?
          "Yes".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Did I go against my will?

          The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Now, who's next?

          LT.HICOX
          Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the
          four of us are very good friends. And
          the four of us haven't seen each other
          in quite a while. So...
          Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the
          fraulein considers my presence a
          intrusion, that I become a intruder.
          How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?

          BRIDGET
          Of course not, Major.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I didn't think so. It's simply the young
          Cap't is immune to my charms.
          The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
          Then, the Major laughs.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.

          

          

          

          

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen,
          and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.

          Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old
          single malt scotch whisky from the
          Scottish highlands. What do you say
          gentlemen?

          LT.HICOX
          Your most gracious, sir.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
          You don't want to contaminate the thirty-
          three with the swill you were drinking.

          ERIC
          How many glasses?

          LT.HICOX
          Five glasses.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like
          me.

          BRIDGET
          Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
          Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
          owner.

          LT.HICOX
          Three glasses.
          Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for
          the three soldiers.
          Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          To a thousand year Reich!
          They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses.
          The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
          CLICK, under the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Did you hear that? That's the sound of
          my Luger pointed right at your testicles.

          Because you've just given yourself
          away, Cap't. Your no more German then
          that scotch.

          You were saying?

          LT.HICOX
          I was saying that makes two of us. I've
          had a gun pointed at your balls since
          you sat down.

          That makes three of us.

          UNDERTABLE

          as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty
          gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

          Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit
          of a sticky situation here.

          LT. H ICOX
          What's going to happen, Major, is your
          going to stand up, and walk out that
          door with us.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          No no no no no no, I don't think so.
          I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter
          what happens to anybody else in this room,
          the two of us aren't going anywhere.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          (pointing behind
          him at the table)
          Too bad about them though. They seem
          like a likeable
          (referring to
          Stiglitz and Wicki)
          You two will have to shoot them.

          BRIDGET
          Then Major, i implore you. For the
          sake of those German troops, will
          you please leave with us?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Oh Bridget, your concern for German
          troops, gets me
          (Pointing at
          his heart)
          .right here. You mean for the sake
          your whore legs, don't you? You can't
          afford to get any bullet holes in them,
          your not finished spreading them for
          all the Hollywood Jews.
          Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt
          scotch, and says;

          LT.HICOX

          'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope
          you dont mind if I go out speaking
          the kings?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          (ENGLISH)
          By all means, Cap't.
          The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three
          the Nazi Major bought him, and says;

          LT.HICOX
          There's a special rung in hell reserved
          for people who waste good scotch.
          And seeing as I might be rapping on
          the door momentarily...
          He downs the stuff.

          LT.HICOX
          (To the Nazi

          MAJOR)
          I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

          

          

          

          
          He puts the glass down.

          LT.HICOX
          Now about this, "Pickle", we find
          ourself's in. It would appear, there's
          only thing left for you to do.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          And what would that be?

          Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls!

          STIGLITZ
          FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS...
          As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
          well.

          HELLSTROM
          FIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.

          STIGLITZ
          then JUMPS over the table, and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the

          DAGGER.
          HICOX FALLS to the floor....DEAD.
          BRIDGET FALLS to the floor.,SHOT.

          WICKI
          brings his weapon out from underneath the table, and BEGINS
          FIRING across at The GERMANS at the table, who unaware, were
          still PLAYING THE GAME.

          WINNETOU
          is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knew what was happening.
          EDGAR WALLACE and The FRENCH BARMAID
          are both SHOT by WICKI.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
          FEMALE SGT.BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each
          other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many
          BULLETS, it's almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the
          floor.

          The SHOOTING STOPS...the SMOKE caused by the gunfire ... starts
          to DISSIPATE... The only one in the room left alive, is the
          young German Sgt, with the machine gunn.
          WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement
          entrance.
          The door opens...
          , .The German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors
          direction...
          No one goes through it.
          What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one
          inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in.
          The young German Sgt, YELLS in ENGLISH, to the outside;

          GERMAN SGT
          You outside! Who are you? British,
          American, what?
          Aldo's Voice YELLS down the hole;

          German!

          GERMAN SGT
          I agree! So let's talk!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay, talk!

          GERMAN SGT
          I'm a father! My baby was born today
          in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name
          is Max! We were in here drinking and
          celebrating! They're the ones that
          came in shooting and killing!
          It's not my fault!

          

          

          

          
          Ito.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault!
          What's your name soldier?

          GERMAN SGT
          Wilhelm!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          That's the same name as one of the
          guys you just killed!

          WILHELM
          They attacked us!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive
          on our side?

          WILHELM
          No!
          We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out;

          BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm alive!
          Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

          STILL

          R
          On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the
          alive Bridget Von Hammersmark.
          The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at
          the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Who's that?

          WILHELM
          (To BRIDGET,

          LOW)
          Make a sound whore, and I spit!
          Meaning the muzzle.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Wilhelm, who is that?

          WILHELM
          is the girl on your side?
          Pause.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Which girl?

          

          

          

          

          WILHELM
          1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Yeah, she's oar's!

          WILHELM
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          I thought so. So you run with the
          American's now, huh? Now times are
          bad?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Is she okay?

          WILHELM
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          You despicable traitor.
          (To Aldo)
          She's been shot, but she's alive.
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          For now.
          We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we
          make a deal?

          WILHELM
          What's your name?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi?

          WILHELM
          Yes.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          So Willi, you know we could lob three
          or four or five or six grenades down
          there, and your little war story ends
          here. But good fer you, bad fer her,
          you die, she dies. So what say we
          make a swap?

          WILLI
          Keep talking?

          

          

          

          

          112.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let
          me and one of my men come down to
          take the girl away! And we take the
          girl, and leave! That simple, Willi!
          You go your way, we go ours! And little
          Max, gets to grow up playing catch with
          his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we
          got a deal?
          Willi thinks...
          Bridget watches Willi think...

          WILLI
          Aldo?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm here Willi!

          WILLI
          I want to trust you.... But howcanI?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          What choice ya got?

          WILLI
          I could kill the girl!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Well now, Willi, that's true enough.
          But something you need to know, so
          you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
          none of us give a fuck bout that
          girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
          her, it would fuck up our plans. But
          you'll be dead by then anyway, so
          what'd you care? And lets not
          forget that little gatzenjammer
          Max, growin up without a pop. So in
          the spirit of gettin you home to
          him, we got a deal, Willi?

          WILLI
          Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you!
          Come down, no guns!
          Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
          Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them.
          Aldo with his hands up, says;

          A

          

          

          

          

          ALDO
          Hey Willi, what's with the machine
          gunny I thought we had a deal?

          WILLI
          We do have a deal, now git the girl
          and go.

          ALDO
          Not so fast, Willi, we only have a
          deal, we trust each other. A Mexican
          stand off ain't trust.

          WILLI
          You need guns on me for it to be
          a Mexican stand off.

          ALDO
          you got guns on us, you decide to
          shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got
          grenades, they drop 'em down here,
          your dead. That's a Mexican stand
          off, and that wasn't the deal.

          WILLI
          Just take that fucking traitor, and
          go! See? Now your down here
          Now you get tricky - t

          ALDO
          - No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin
          tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm
          too damn dumb toget tricky. But

          (MEANING

          HIRSCHBERG)
          him and I lived upto the deal. We
          came down without guns. Now it's
          your turn. No trust,no deal.
          Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...

          ALDO
          i know your scarred. I'm scarred,
          he's scarred, we're all scarred.
          So what's it gonnabe Willi?
          Ether we got a deal, or you might
          as well just shoot us now.
          Willi decides...
          He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.

          

          

          

          

          WILLI
          Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
          get her out of my sight.

          ALDO
          Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg,
          you grab her shoulder -

          WHEN...
          From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
          Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
          Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
          Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked.

          ALDO
          You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with
          that man!
          From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
          (she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the
          two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time;

          BRIDGET
          He was a enemy soldier, who knew who
          I was. He couldn't live.

          3
          Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
          hard in the side.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I ought'a beat your fuckin head in

          ALDO
          Stop it. Just pick her up, and get
          that bitch outta here.

          HIRSCHBERG
          Aldo, she just-

          ALDO
          - She's right.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What?

          ALDO
          I said, she's right. He was a Nazi
          soldier. If he lived, he would doomed
          the mission.
